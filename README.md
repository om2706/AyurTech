AyurTech:

India, with a rich heritage of floral diversity, is well-known for its medicinal plant wealth, but their identification is one of the major burning issues in Ayurvedic Pharmaceutics. Several crude drugs are being sold under the same name in the market leading to confusion and their misidentification. Even the collectors and traders are not completely aware of the exact morphological appearance or differentiating attributes of the many drugs owing to seasonal and geographical availability, and similar characteristics. . Thus, software capable of identifying different medicinal plants/ raw materials through Image Processing Using Different Machine Learning Algorithms.

The Medicinal Plant Recognition and Feature Analysis project harnesses the power of machine learning to provide a user-friendly tool for plant enthusiasts, herbalists, and researchers. By accurately identifying medicinal plants and extracting their features.


Machine Learning: The image recognition component will be powered by state-of-the-art deep learning models such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained on a diverse dataset of medicinal plants.

Web/Mobile Development: For the user interface, technologies like NextJS , ReactJS for web applications or React Native for cross-platform mobile apps will be employed.
